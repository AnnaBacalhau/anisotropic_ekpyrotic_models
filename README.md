This works belong to the domain of Cosmology. A class of alternative models to the Big Bang, 
called Ekpyrotic models, were studied numerically and analytically. By means of the algorithm developed we
were able to discover new physical regimes not yet identified in the specialized literature. The data analysis
was able to correlate the range of model parameters to the different regimes observed.
